currently on v1.0
The code is unfinished.

The purpose of this code is to allow a user to create a flight path for a drone or UAV in google earth pro using the path tool or waypoint tool and export the path as a .KML file. 
The program then converts the path into a .PATH file usable in QGroundControll for mission planning purposes.
